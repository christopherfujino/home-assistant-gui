## Script

- Initial idea
    - Combine
        - Lexie's interest in plants
        - Lexie's skills in designing new products
        - My interest in writing new kinds of software
    - Create a device that can monitor a plant
- Philosophy
    - Should not feel like a "computer", but rather a device with a single purpose
    - I love technology, but not hyperconnectivity
        - Should be self-contained, no networking, no mobile app
        - To find out how the plant is doing, you still need to walk over to it
- Technical problems to solve:
